2. Knowledge of git and github.

Hacktoberfest is a program by Digital Ocean, DEV and Github, where you can easily win a T-Shirt just by making 4 pull requests in the month of October to any open source projects on Github.

## How to get started (Follow the steps)

### 0. Register for Hacktoberfest

https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/

### 1. Give this Project a Star :star:

as you can and star this repo to help as many people in opensource as you can.

### 2. Fork Repository

You can fork repository in which you want to contribute.
fork:- (means) it create a copy of repository in your account to commit.

### 3. Clone Repository

after forking type following command in terminal to clone in your pc
```
git clone https://github.com/user-name/Hacktober2020.git
```

replace user-name with your github username

or

you can get a link from green button click to copy that link
that link must be from your own forked copy.

### 4. Create branch

Type following command in terminal window

```
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

### 5. Add code in respective languages folder 

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing
Firstly, Add your name in contributors list.
then, start contributing.
create program file and write code into it.
e.g. abc.cpp

### 6. Commit Changes 

Type following commands

```
git add .
git commit -m "message about commit"
```

### 7. Pull changes 

To get latest code
Type following command 

```
git pull upstream master
```

### 8. Configure a Remote for the Fork

Next, you’ll have to specify a new remote upstream repository for us to sync with the fork. This will be the original repository that you forked from. You’ll have to do this with the `git remote add` command.

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ALLINONE4298/Hacktober2020.git
```

In this example, `upstream` is the shortname we have supplied for the remote repository since in terms of Git, “upstream” refers to the repository that you cloned from. If you want to add a remote pointer to the repository of a collaborator, you may want to provide that collaborator’s username or a shortened nickname for the shortname.

### 9. Push changes to Github

Type following command

```
git push --set-upstream origin new-branch-name
```

### 10. Create Pull Request

At this point, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.

You should navigate to your forked repository, and press the “New pull request” button on your left-hand side of the page.

### 11. And wait for owner to merge

If there is no merge conflict then owner will merge your pull request.
Have patience and contribute more.

## Hurray!! You just successfully create your first pull request
